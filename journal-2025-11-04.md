  - Region-based analysis with grouping
  - Error handling for missing/empty files
  - Command-line argument processing

#### sales_data.csv (Sample Data)
- 25 sample sales records
- Date range: January 2024
- Fields: Date, Product, Region, Amount, Quantity, Salesperson
- Products: Laptop, Mouse, Keyboard, Monitor
- Regions: North, South, East, West
- Salespeople: Alice Johnson, Bob Smith, Carol Davis, David Lee

#### requirements.txt
